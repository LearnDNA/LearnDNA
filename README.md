# LearnDNA

## The idea
What would you do if you had the blueprint to a virus or cancer?

Would you not turn it off?  Of perhaps render it a healthy protean that could be beneficial.

What is the difference between it, and 1's and 0's?  Rather than two types (1, 0) or binary, there are four (G, C, T, A), or quadnary.  How is it any different in code from a computer program?  The answer: It isn't.  It is a logical grouping of compressed data that can be extracted and read.  We just don't know how yet.

What if there was a way? How much would it be worth?  Ebola, for example, is a virus. Something interesting about a virus is generally their dna strand is very short compared to an animal or a plant.  Plants dna is actually are more complex than human DNA much of the time.  So here is the thing, nobody can read dna like a computer language, ie: like a blueprint.  

Enter: deep learning  Teach a horde of computers to do it for you.  Deep learning is the practice of applying big data to patterns, and obtaining valuable information from it.  Viruses mutate, and so do the affects on their hosts over time.  We can track strands of virus easily, we have the data of their hosts, their temperature, their age, how they were affected.  So compare those changes on a massive scale, and now you have a baseline for comparing what changed in the virus.

From that, you can start to reverse engineer the structure from the alterations in their genome.  After we a foundation or core is created, start to get an idea of the structure of a single type of virus, from various strands, start comparing very similar viruses.  I've already talked with doctors and nurses, and they all say: "Sign me up! I can't believe nobody has thought of that!"

Here is the thing, it has been done before, but in a different way.  Google did it with longitude and latitude.  These are tricky to tie to the earth because the earth changes, and you must be at the address to obtain the gps coordinates more or less.

Google did this:  
When you log in, to create a user account they ask you to enter in a code to ensure you are a human, right?  You are teaching a computer how to read, at the same time.  Every time it happens, the computer gets smarter.  They had the google car record images and at the same time longitude and latitude.  They told the computer to read the images, and tell what longitude and latitude it was taken.  They did this for the entire of France.

It took less than two hours.

The computer doesn't care, it just sees data.  For the project I'm calling "LearnDNA" we apply the same sorts of statistics, just from a different source.
Lets apply the deep learning practised in France to Malaria.
Our GPS are the hospital statistics.
The image will be the genome of the virus.
The entries to learn numbers will be the dna mutations.

I personally think that is a billion dollar idea, perhaps much more.  But, not because I want to get rich, but because I want to help us learn dna.

If you could solve cancer or ebola, how much would it be worth to you?

Here is the thing though: I want to give it away for free.

open source.

But imagine what hospitals, doctors, and organizations could do if they had the blueprint.
